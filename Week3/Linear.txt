1. Feature and Error should be independent of each Other
# Multicolinearity Assumption
2. X1 and x2 should be Completed independent of each Other and if not then model is not interpritable
3. x1,x2,x3,x4 are independent variable and we try to predict all Feature value for diffenrent combination
4. If Rsquare is Less then Feature in independent variable but Rsquare is more then Feature is dependent vairbale on each Other.
5. Model Selection process 

# 3 HeteroScedsticity
# 1. Homoscedasticity Assumption
# 2. Residuals should be randomly scattered around the horizontal axis
# 3. If Residuals are not randomly scattered then model is not good
the variance of the Error is same across then model is called Homoscedasticity.
The Varaince of the Error is Changing then model is called HeteroScedsticity.

# 4 Distribution opf the Error
  All the Error Should be Closed to Zero and frequency should be more near Zero.
  The Distribution Should be Normal Bell Shape Curve

IN SLR we should high R2 Square

IMP
1. Error and Feature Should be independent of Each Other
2.The Feature should be internaly independent each Other it will impact the interpritabilty of the model
3. Varaince of the Error Should be Constant Homoscedasticity and variance of the Error is Changinh then it is HeteroScedsticity
4. Error should be Normal Distributed with the frequency will be near to Zero


The End Goal of Machine Learning Model to create model interpritable
